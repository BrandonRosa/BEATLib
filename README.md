# BEATLib

BEATLib is a cross-platform, cross-game library designed to make scripted events dealing with games or real-life lighting universal. The goal of BEATLib is to create a `.beat` file format that serves as a universal standard, similar to MIDI, but applicable to any scripted sequence. With BEATLib, you can take lighting effects from a game and turn them into a light show sequence, or transfer rhythm patterns from one game to another seamlessly.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: BEATLib is designed to work across various platforms and game engines.
- **Universal Event Scripting**: Easily script song events (BEATEvents) that any program can hook into, allowing for custom code execution when events are triggered.
- **Versatility**: Whether it's creating a light show from in-game lighting effects or mapping rhythm patterns across different games, BEATLib provides the tools to do it all.
